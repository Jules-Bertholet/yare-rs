# Rust bindings for [Yare.io](https://yare.io/) bots

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yareio-sys?style=flat-square)](https://crates.io/crates/yareio-sys) [![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/yareio-sys?color=blue&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Jules-Bertholet/yareio-rs)

This crate uses [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) to expose the objects available to
[Yare.io](https://yare.io/) bots to Rust.
It's meant to be used with [`yareio-rust-template`](https://github.com/Jules-Bertholet/yareio-rust-template),
which contains custom build scripts necessary to make `wasm-bindgen` work with Yare.

This crate is documented with [Rustdoc](https://jules-bertholet.github.io/yareio-rs/yareio_sys/).

This crate is compatible with TypeScript, but you will need to use the TypeScript types from
[`yareio-typescript-typings`](https://github.com/Jules-Bertholet/yareio-typescript-typings).

See also [yare-rust](https://github.com/ViliamVadocz/yare-rust) for an alternative to this crate.

## Usage notes

The methods and structs this crate provides map pretty directly to what's available in JS.
This means they won't always be idiomatic Rust. For example, `Deref`-based inheritance is ued extensively;
this is [an antipattern](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/anti_patterns/deref.md) for idiomatic
Rust but it's also the most performant way to represent JS inheritance hierarchies, and it's what `wasm-bindgen` uses.
The idiomatic alternative would be to use trait objects, but this would add additional dynamic dispatch on top of what
JS already does, making it slower.

Passing values between WebAssembly and JS is slow, especially when those values aren't numbers.
Generally, any method in this crate that returns a value involves such a transfer of data
(functions that return static references don't).
So be careful, and only retrieve the information you need.

For the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraphs, you may want to create you own structs and data structures to
store the information you need.

### Shape features

To access shape-specific methods like `merge()`, `jump()`, and `explode()`, you'll need to enable the crate feature
corresponding to the shape you play with in your `Cargo.toml`. The available shape features are `circles`, `squares`,
and `triangles`.

### Prelude

This crate has a `prelude` module that re-exports the most useful items. You can bulk-import them all with

```rust
use yareio_sys::prelude::*;
```

### `RenderService` bindings

This crate optionally provides bindings for [`yare-code-sync`](https://github.com/arikwex/yare-code-sync)'s
`RenderService`, under the `render_service` module. You will need to enable the crate's `RenderService` feature to
use these bindings.
